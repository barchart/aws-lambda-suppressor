**Bug Fixes**

* Update [@barchart/common-node-js](https://github.com/barchart/common-node-js) dependency. Update fixes regression that caused any output from a `LambdaValidator` to be considered valid by the `LambdaHelper.porocess` function. In other words, invalid events will no longer be processed.
